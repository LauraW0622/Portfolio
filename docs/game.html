        <h1>Oregon Trail: Game Analysis</h1>
        <p> The graphics are extremely simple utilizing basic 8-bit limited color palet and
            pixelized characters, animals, scenery, wagon, rivers, forts, and landmarks. Even with
            the limited graphics, the text-based formatting of the game allows you get the sense of
            adventure wondering what the next landmark, illness, or issue will occur next. </p>
        <h4>LETS GET STARTED</h4>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/StartScreen.png" alt="Start Screen" />
        <p>The start screen gives you 6 options. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Travel the trail</li>
            <li>2. Learn about the trail</li>
            <li>3. See the Oregon Top Ten</li>
            <li>4. Turn sound off</li>
            <li>5. Choose Managent Options</li>
            <li>6. End (END GAME)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By selecting the 1st option you kick of the game, but lets talk about the other options
            for minute.</p>
        <p>In option 2, the games discusses your journey through the game as well as some keys to
            control sound and exiting the game.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.1.png" alt="About the trail 1" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.2.png" alt="About the trail 2" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.3.png" alt="About the trail 3" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.4.png" alt="About the trail 4" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.5.png" alt="About the trail 5" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.6.png" alt="About the trail 6" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.7.png" alt="About the trail 7" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.8.png" alt="About the trail 8" />
        <p>The settings are minimal, there are no sounds to the game but you can control how much
            the group eats (“filling”, “measly”, “barely”) but that is about all. You travel along a
            linear path from Missouri to Oregon passing key landmarks, rivers, and forts. You are
            not able to explore anything around the landmarks but can shop at local stores at the
            forts to replenish supplies. </p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/store_1.png" alt="store" />
        <p> You are placed in the role of leader. You enter your name and select your profession but
            have no true characteristics. You can also name the rest of your party but do not
            control them. What you can control is the management of the entire party’s health,
            supplies, and pace. The NPC players are people or Native American Indians in the forts.
            You can talk to a player chosen by the game who will usually tell you something about
            the town or culture. </p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/choose_profession.png" alt="choosing profession" />
        <p> The main challenge is ensuring that your party has adequate food and supplies, and are
            travelling at the correct pace. Going too fast can cause exhaustion and illness (which
            can lead to the death of party members) but going too slow will deplete food resources
            and supplies before the ability to restock presents itself. </p>
        <p> There are no objects that you can directly observe or pick up. You are able to trade at
            the forts to gain supplies without having to purchase them. The objects you cannot
            continue without are: oxen, wagon wheels, wagon axles, and wagon tongues. </p>
        <p> The game does not really break the fourth wall or comment on itself. It’s a straight
            play simulation. </p>
        <p> The game reflects on the historical pioneer experience of the westward expansion in 19th
            century America. It touches on themes of survival and manifest destiny. By today’s
            standards, the game lakes representation. The main characters are implied to be white
            settlers. There are some interactions with Native Americans throughout the game, someone
            of which state their distaste of their lands being disrupted by the influx of settlers. </p>
        <p> There have been some remakes to the Oregon Trail game but some changes to improve the
            game would be: 
        <ul>
            <li>Updated graphics, sound, and music.</li>
            <li>Meaning choices and branching paths to allow for multiple playthroughs.</li>
            <li>Expanded cast and characters to interact with.</li>
            <li>Better depiction of the history behind the westward expansion, showcasing human
                cost, moral complexity, and difficulty.</li>
        </ul>
