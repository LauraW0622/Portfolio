        <h1>Oregon Trail: Game Analysis</h1>
        <p class="game"> The graphics are extremely simple utilizing basic 8-bit limited color palet and
            pixelized characters, animals, scenery, wagon, rivers, forts, and landmarks. Even with
            the limited graphics, the text-based formatting of the game allows you get the sense of
            adventure wondering what the next landmark, illness, or issue will occur next. </p>
        <h4 class="game">LETS GET STARTED</h4>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/StartScreen.png" alt="Start Screen" />
        <p class="game">The start screen gives you 6 options. </p>
        <div class="gamelist">
            <ol class="game">
                <li>Travel the trail</li>
                <li>Learn about the trail</li>
                <li>See the Oregon Top Ten</li>
                <li>Turn sound off</li>
                <li>Choose Managent Options</li>
                <li>End (EXIT GAME)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="game">By selecting the 1st option you kick of the game, but lets talk about the other options
            for minute.</p>
        <p class="game">In option 2, the games discusses your journey through the game as well as some keys to
            control sound and exiting the game and finally the credit to the software engineers
            responsible for the game development.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.1.png" alt="About the trail 1" />

        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/aboutTheTrail.8.png" alt="About the trail 8" />
        <p class="game">Option 3 allows you to see the top scoring ten players of all time for the game.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/top10.png" alt="Top 10" />
        <p class="game">If you would like turn the sound off before even begininning the game you can selection
            option 4. I did not provide a screenshot, it's self explanatory.</p>
        <p class="game">The management options are located in option 5 from the start screen.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/managementOpt.png" alt="Management Options" />
        <p class="game">Once you decide to start the game, there are 3 occupations you can choose to be. A banker
            will provide you with the most money to begininng, meaning you can start with more food
            and supplies making the journey easier. However, by choosing the banker you will not
            gain as many points for your achievements at the end. A carpenter has a moderate amount
            of money for food and supplies and will gain a moderate amount of points at completion
            of the trails. A farmer will provide you with the least amount of money for food and
            supplies, but will reap the most points in the end.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/occupation.png" alt="Occupations" />
        <p class="game"> After choosing your occupation, you are taken the following screens where you name the
            leader of the group and the group members.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/names.1.png" alt="Leader Name" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/names.2.png" alt="Group Name" />
        <p class="game">Now that you have your group members names sorted, you need to decide when you want to
            leave. Leaving too early can cause issues like cold weather, blizzards, increased
            illness, and scarce food for the oxen. Leaving too late can cause issues like extremely
            hot weather, drought leading to dehydration for your group and oxen.</p>
        <p class="game">There are 3 occupations you can choose to be. A banker will provide you with the most
            money to begininng, meaning you can start with more food and supplies making the journey

        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/leaveDate.png" alt="Leave date" />
        <p class="game">Before setting off you need to purchase supplies. As mentioned before you have a set
            amount of money based on your profession to stock up on a sufficient amount of oxen,
            food, clothing, ammunition for hunting (in the event you run low on food rations), and
            spare parts. This is mostly subjective but there are suggestions for each on the
            amount.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/money.png" alt="Money" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/mattsGenStore.png" alt="Matt's General Store" />
        <p class="game">Now that you have your supplies, we set off!</p>
        <p class="game">Before leaving we view our group stats: </p>
        <div class="gamelist">
            <ul class="game">
                <li>Weather</li>
                <li>Health</li>
                <li>Pace</li>
                <li>Rations</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/startStats.png" alt="Start Stats" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/leaveIndependence.png" alt="Leave Independence" />
        <p class="game">Everytime you leave a landmark or new location the game will notify you of the distance
            to the next location.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/distanceToNext.png" alt="Distance to next" />
        <p class="game">Unfortunately for me, one of my group members got the measles right out of the gate!</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/danMeasles.png" alt="Dan gets measles" />
        <p class="game">A few days after setting of we arrive at the first landmark! We are given the option to
            look around, if you select yes you are show a dipiction of the landmark or fort (I
            choose to do this later in the game).</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/landmarkLook.png" alt="Landmark Look" />
        <p class="game">At our first landmark we need to cross a river. The game will give some information about
            width depth to help you make a decision about your method of crossing.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/riverCrossing.png" alt="River Crossing" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/riverCrossing1.png" alt="River Crossing" />
        <p class="game">You may not always make the right choice... I chose to float across the fiver and while
            Dan recovered from the measles, he tragically drown.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/riverCrossFloat.png" alt="Float the river" />
        <p class="game">While traversing the trail you can run into all types of weather as mentioned before,
            about one week into travel I encounter a severe storm and lose 1 day of travel.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/weather.png" alt="Weather" />
        <p class="game">Because there were no exact maps at the time, you can often lose track of where you are
            and lose a few days of travel.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/loseTrail.png" alt="Lose trail" />
        <p class="game">My ox decided to wander off!! I loose a day but good thing I have more oxen than we
            need.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/oxWander.png" alt="Ox wanders off" />
        <p class="game">In the beginning you have he option to purchase extra parts for the wagon. Well good
            thing I did since on June 10th I break the tongue of the wagon.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/brokenTongue.png" alt="Broken Tongue" />
        <p class="game">It is also possible to find items along the trail from other wagons.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/find.png" alt="Find items" />
        <p class="game">Once I arrive at Fort Hall I do take the option to look around and talk to some other
            people at the fort.</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/lookAround.png" alt="Fort Hall look aroud" />
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/talkTopeople.png" alt="Talk to people" />
        <p class="game">In the end I ultimately make it to Oregon!</p>
        <img class="game" src="images/gameimages/weMadeIt.png" alt="Made it" />
        <p class="game">While I did make it to Oregon the road was not easy, I lost three of my group members to
            illness or drowning and encountered some rough weather, broken wagon parts, and
            illness.</p>

        <div class="analysis">
            <h4 class="analysis">Game Analysis</h4>
            <p class="analysis">The settings are minimal, there are no sounds to the game but you can control how
                much the group eats (“filling”, “measly”, “barely”) but that is about all. You
                travel along a linear path from Missouri to Oregon passing key landmarks, rivers,
                and forts. You are not able to explore anything around the landmarks but can shop at
                local stores at the forts to replenish supplies. </p>
            <p class="analysis"> You are placed in the role of leader. You enter your name and select your profession
                but have no true characteristics. You can also name the rest of your party but do
                not control them. What you can control is the management of the entire party’s
                health, supplies, and pace. The NPC players are people or Native American Indians in
                the forts. You can talk to a player chosen by the game who will usually tell you
                something about the town or culture. </p>
            <p class="analysis"> The main challenge is ensuring that your party has adequate food and supplies, and
                are travelling at the correct pace. Going too fast can cause exhaustion and illness
                (which can lead to the death of party members) but going too slow will deplete food
                resources and supplies before the ability to restock presents itself. </p>
            <p class="analysis"> There are no objects that you can directly observe or pick up. You are able to trade
                at the forts to gain supplies without having to purchase them. The objects you
                cannot continue without are: oxen, wagon wheels, wagon axles, and wagon tongues. </p>
            <p class="analysis"> The game does not really break the fourth wall or comment on itself. It’s a straight
                play simulation. </p>
            <p class="analysis"> The game reflects on the historical pioneer experience of the westward expansion in
                19th century America. It touches on themes of survival and manifest destiny. By
                today’s standards, the game lakes representation. The main characters are implied to
                be white settlers. There are some interactions with Native Americans throughout the
                game, someone of which state their distaste of their lands being disrupted by the
                influx of settlers. </p>
            <p class="analysis"> There have been some remakes to the Oregon Trail game but some changes to improve
                the game would be: 
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Updated graphics, sound, and music.</li>
                    <li>Meaning choices and branching paths to allow for multiple playthroughs.</li>
                    <li>Expanded cast and characters to interact with.</li>
                    <li>Better depiction of the history behind the westward expansion, showcasing
                        human cost, moral complexity, and difficulty.</li>
