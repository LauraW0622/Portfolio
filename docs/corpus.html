                    <figcaption class="n3gram"> I'd like to compare writings from 1930's through the
                        1960's to radio plays of around the same time. I expect to find similar
                        phrasing between the two writings. I ran some 3-grams on a collection of
                        radio plays and magazine articles of the same period. The 3-gram didn't
                        reveal much as you can see above. </figcaption>

                    <figcaption class="n5gram"> Since the 3-gram was unrevealing, I tried to refine
                        my corpus sets to suspense radio plays and fiction writings from 1938 to
                        1961. Unfortunately, it seems that the radio plays have alot of HTML in
                        them, so when I ran a 5-gram on the collection there isn't much in the way
                        of phrases, but more a collection of HTML phrases. It looks as though I may
                        need to find a differnt collection or refine the data in the current
                        collection. </figcaption>
