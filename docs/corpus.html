            <p> From 1930 to 1960, the United States was marked by shifts in societal values as well
                as geopolitical dynamics. In this study, we will dive into the textual realm of this
                era through comparitive corpus analysis of magazine articles and presidential
                speeches. The objective of the analysis is to illustrate distinct rhetoric, thematic
                content, and linguistic patterns from magazines and presidents of the time. By
                comparing the the two forms of communication, we aim to discern how societal
                narratives and political rhetoric intersected one another. </p>

            <p> To begin the investigation into the linguistics most prevalent in magazine articles
                and presidential speeches from the period spanning 1930 through 1960, we analyze the
                top ten trigrams in each corpus. Indentification of trigrams within the texts allow
                us to disern lexical patterns, semantic emphases and rhetoric utilized by both
                mediums of communication.
            </p> 
            <h6>Magazine Articles (left):</h6>
            <p> We notice a pattern beginning to emerge that starts to encapsulate the
                prevelant themes characteristic of the era. Most notably, the trigrams "the u s" and
                "the united states" emphasize the focus on national identity and geopolitics,
                understandly so in a period marked by domestic challenges and global disruption. We
                can also consider the large number of negative rhetoric within the words "didn't"
                and "couldn't" possibly hinting at negative societal attitudes and complexities of
                the everyday life during the time. </p>
            <h6>Presidential Speeches (right):</h6>
            <p> Similar to the magazine articles, the trigrams within the presidential speeches 
                highlight a time steeped in political discourse and national aspirations. The trigrams 
                "the united states", "of the united", and "of the world" draw attention to the emphasis 
                on diplomatic relations and geopolitical landscape you would expect from the President. 
                Phrases such as "the fiscal year" and "to the congress" shine light to the administrative
                priorities and legislative agenda during this pivotal jucture in history.                
            </p>

                    <img class="collate" src="images/corpusImages/mag.theunitedstates.collate.png"
                        alt="Magazine Collate for 'The United States'" />
                </div>
                <div class="wrapper">
                    <img class="collate" src="images/corpusImages/prez.theunitedstates.collate.png"
                        alt="Presidential Speeches Collate for 'The United States'" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> In addition to examing the top trigrams, we extend our analysis into the exploration of 
                collocates withing each corpus. Collocates can offer nuance insights into the semantic 
                association, context, and thematic emphasis embedded within the texts. Scrutinizing the most
                prominent collocates alongside their frequency and statistical measure, we aim to uncover 
                potential indirect (or direct) patterns within each corpus.
            </p> 
            <h6>Magazine Articles (left):</h6>
            <p> The analysis of collocates within the magazine articles reveal connections to the prevelant themes 
                observed within the trigrams. The presence of "Canada" and "Britian" place further emphasis on the 
                geopolitical engagements of the time.
            </p>
            <h6>Presidential Speeches (right):</h6>
            <p> Similarly, the collocates identified within the presidential speeches associate back to the trigrams 
                with a high emphasis the need for governance and public address. The words "President", "people" and 
                "Congress" are prominent collocates further reflecting a thematic emphasis on executive authority 
                and democratic ethos.

            </div>
            <p> In the analysis of the linguistic patterns and thematic context surround the 5-gram "the United States 
                Information Agency", we explore its instances within each corpus.
            </p> 
            <p> The KWIC examination of the instances surroundig this 5-gram unviels a diverse theme. The magazine articles 
                primarly seem to focus on adminstrative and operational apsects associated with the agency. Whereas, the 
                presidential speeches highlight political importance and objectives linked the agencies role in international 
                affairs reguarding Antartica.

                </div>
            </div>
            <p> Upon a KWIC investigation of a common 5-gram "citizens of Japanese ancestry" within the magazine articles, it 
                became apparent that a specific article focuses on the issue of civil liberities and advocacy within the Japanese-American
                community during the last few year of the second World War. We needed to determine if there was a similar thematic presence 
                surrounding Japan within the presidential speeches. It is determined that the speeches only highlight geopolitical dynamics 
                and post-war recontruction effort shaping the U.S.-Japanese relations in the aftermath of the war.

            </div>
            <p> Cirrus visualization offer a graphical snapshot of the lexical landscape and thematic emphasis within each corpus. It appears 
                that while the magazine articles reflect a spectrum of societal concern and economic policy, the presidential speeches foreground 
                a highly political charge (as expected) tailor the address of governancy, security and diplomacy. By exploring the associations and 
                contextual nuance of each text we can conclude that while each medium has a dissimilar focus the over thematic prevelance mirros the 
                national and global events, policies, and social expectation of the time.
