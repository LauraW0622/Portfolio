                <figcaption>Gemini is a 14 year old Rottweiler-Beagle mix. This 35lb princess refuses to go outside
                    in inclement weather, and is very demanding about what she wants. She can be such a silly girl and 
                    loves to scratch her back upside down. In her free time, she handles my books (see picture on right).</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Kodi is a 4 year old, 50lb, Australian Shepherd mix. You can tell how he is feeling by just looking at
                his ears! Happy? Ears up! Bored? Ears down! Perplexed? Check out the left photo! He is super playful, but doesn't
                ever know when to STOP! In a past life, he was a thug (see right photo).</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Bayne is a 3 year old pure-breed AKC registered Great Dane! He's a whopping 160lb.... BABY! He loves 
                a good snuggle more than anything else in the world. When he's not looking dapper (see left photo), he's tormenting
                his older brother Kodi (see right photo)!</figcaption>
